6.2.0
=====

Features
--------
* Improved team collection for data distribution that builds a balanced number of teams per server and gurantees that each server has at least one team. `(PR #1785) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1785>`_.

* CMake is now our official build system. The Makefile based build system is deprecated.

* Added local ratekeeper, to throttle reads at a per-storage-process level. `(PR #1447) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1477>`_.

Performance
-----------

* Use CRC32 checksum for SQLite pages. `(PR #1582) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1582>`_.
* Added a 96-byte fast allocator, so storage queue nodes use less memory. `(PR #1336) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1336>`_.
* Handle large packets better. `(PR #1684) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1684>`_.

Fixes
-----

* Set the priority of redundant teams to remove as PRIORITY_TEAM_REDUNDANT, instead of PRIORITY_TEAM_UNHEALTHY. `(PR #1802) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1802>`_.
* During an upgrade, the multi-version client now persists database default options and transaction options that aren't reset on retry (e.g. transaction timeout). In order for these options to function correctly during an upgrade, a 6.2 or later client should be used as the primary client. `(PR #1767) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1767>`_.
* If a cluster is upgraded during an ``onError`` call, the cluster could return a ``cluster_version_changed`` error. `(PR #1734) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1734>`_.
* Do not set doBuildTeams in StorageServerTracker unless a storage server's interface changes, in order to avoid unnecessary work. `(PR #1779) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1779>`_.

Status
------

* Added ``run_loop_busy`` to the ``processes`` section to record the fraction of time the run loop is busy. `(PR #1760) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1760>`_.
* Added ``cluster.page_cache`` section to status. In this section, added two new statistics ``storage_hit_rate`` and ``log_hit_rate`` that indicate the fraction of recent page reads that were served by cache. `(PR #1823) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1823>`_.
* Added transaction start counts by priority to ``cluster.workload.transactions``. The new counters are named ``started_immediate_priority``, ``started_default_priority``, and ``started_batch_priority``. `(PR #1836) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1836>`_.
* Remove ``cluster.datacenter_version_difference`` and replace it with ``cluster.datacenter_lag`` that has subfields ``versions`` and ``seconds``. `(PR #1800) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1800>`_.
* Added ``local_rate`` to the ``roles`` section to record the throttling rate of the local ratekeeper `(PR #1712) <http://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1712>`_.

Bindings
--------

* Add a transaction size limit for both database option and transaction option. `(PR #1725) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1725>`_.
* Added a new API to get the approximated transaction size before commit, e.g., ``fdb_transaction_get_approximate_size`` in the C binding. `(PR #1756) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1756>`_.
* C: ``fdb_future_get_version`` has been renamed to ``fdb_future_get_int64``. `(PR #1756) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1756>`_.
* C: Applications linking to libfdb_c can now use ``pkg-config foundationdb-client`` or ``find_package(FoundationDB-Client ...)`` (for cmake) to get the proper flags for compiling and linking. `(PR #1636) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1636>`_.
* Go: The Go bindings now require Go version 1.11 or later.
* Go: Fix issue with finalizers running too early that could lead to undefined behavior. `(PR #1451) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1451>`_.
* Added transaction option to control the field length of keys and values in debug transaction logging in order to avoid truncation. `(PR #1844) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1844>`_.

Other Changes
-------------

* Clients will throw ``transaction_too_old`` when attempting to read if ``setVersion`` was called with a version smaller than the smallest read version obtained from the cluster. This is a protection against reading from the wrong cluster in multi-cluster scenarios. `(PR #1413) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1413>`_.
* Trace files are now ordered lexicographically. This means that the filename format for trace files did change. `(PR #1828) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1828>`_.
* Improved ``TransactionMetrics`` log events by adding a random UID to distinguish multiple open connections, a flag to identify internal vs. client connections, and logging of rates and roughness in addition to total count for several metrics. `(PR #1808) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1808>`_.
* FoundationDB can now be built with clang and libc++ on Linux `(PR #1666) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1666>`_.
* Added experimental framework to run C and Java clients in simulator `(PR #1678) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1678>`_.
* Added new network option for client buggify which will randomly throw expected exceptions in the client. Intended for client testing `(PR #1417) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1417>`_.
* Added ``--cache_memory`` parameter for ``fdbserver`` processes to control the amount of memory dedicated to caching pages read from disk. `(PR #1889) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1889>`_.
* Added ``MakoWorkload``, used as a benchmark to do performance testing of FDB. `(PR #1586) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/1586>`_.
